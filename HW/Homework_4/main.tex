    \label{fig:circuit}
\end{figure}

(a) Draw the truth table of this circuit.\textbf{[10 pt]}

(b) Which kind of arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, shift, or comparison) is performed by this circuit? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit} compared to the corresponding arithmetic circuit mentioned in \href{https://toast-lab.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/CS110@ShanghaiTech/Spring-2024/lecture_notes/L09.\%20Digital\%20circuits\%20and\%20systems\%201.pdf}{Digital circuits I}?\textbf{[10 pt]}

(b) Assume that all 2-input logic gates have 1 ns delay, all 3-input logic gates have 2 ns delay, and other delays are not considered. Calculate the max delay of this circuit.\textbf{[10 pt]}

\section{SDS}
Draw a counter that counts from 0 to 5 using three D flip-flops (each flip-flops represents one output bit) and some 2-input logic gates (AND, OR, NOT). Please use the method taught in class to build a Moore FSM that implements the circular counter. Complete the state transition logic and output logic. \textbf{[35 pt]}

\section{Finite state machine}

The function of a vending machine which sells bottles of soda is described below:

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] Each bottle costs \$1.50. 
\item[$\bullet$] The machine only accepts \$0.50 and \$1 coins. If a customer inserts enough coins, the machine will dispense a bottle of soda (FSM will output ``1", otherwise ``0'') and returns change if needed , e.g., the output of DISPENSE states may be ``1 \$0.5", other states' output may be ``0 \$0''.
\item[$\bullet$] The process happens one coin at a time, and there is no simultaneous insertion of multiple coins or shipping of multiple bottles. After each transaction, the vending machine enters the IDLE state.
\item[$\bullet$] We donâ€™t need to account for a scenario where a customer inserts coins but decides not to make a purchase.
\end{itemize}


(a) Draw the FSM (Moore machine) for this vending machine.\textbf{[15 pt]}

(b) Draw the FSM (Mealy machine) for this vending machine.\textbf{[10 pt]}

(c) Could Moore machines and Mealy machines be converted into each other to implement the same function? Compare their difference.\textbf{[10 pt]}
