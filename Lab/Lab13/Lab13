### Exer 1

环境变量

```shell
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=5
unset OMP_NUM_THREADS
```

### Exer 2

1. <u>Describe the performance differences between the methods you implemented and try to analyze the reason(Run more times to find a common pattern  instead of just running once).</u>

   size of row = 4096 Byte = size of cache line，为什么会和cache有关系呢?

2. Explain why using OpenMP may not necessarily lead to optimal performance on a single compute node with multiple cores.

   multiple cores use shared memory, and data dependency
